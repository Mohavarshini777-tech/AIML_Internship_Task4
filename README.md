# AIML Internship – Task 4
## Logistic Regression – Breast Cancer Classification

### 📌 Objective
Use Logistic Regression to classify tumors as **malignant (0)** or **benign (1)** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

### 📊 Steps Completed
- Loaded Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn
- Performed dataset exploration (shape, missing values, summary)
- Split data into features (X) and target (y)
- Applied StandardScaler for normalization
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

### 🧠 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 0.9737  
- **Confusion Matrix:**
- **Classification Report:**  
Precision, Recall, F1-score all above **0.95**

### 📂 Files Included
- `Task4_LogisticRegression.ipynb` – Main notebook  
- `outputs/breast_cancer_processed.csv` – Saved preprocessed dataset  

### ✔ Conclusion
Logistic Regression achieved **97% accuracy**, proving it is highly effective for binary medical classification tasks.
